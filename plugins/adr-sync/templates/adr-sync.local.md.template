# ADR Sync — Project Configuration
# Copy this file to your project's .claude/adr-sync.local.md and customize.
#
# IMPORTANT: Add '.claude/*.local.md' to your .gitignore
# This file is user-specific and should not be committed to the repository.
#
# This file tells the adr-sync plugin where to find ADRs and which
# documentation files to keep in sync with architecture decisions.

# Path to ADR directory (relative to project root)
adr_path: "docs/architecture/decisions"

# ADR filename pattern (glob)
adr_pattern: "ADR-*.md"

# Files to sync when an ADR is created/modified
# The agent will cross-reference ADRs against these files and update them
sync_targets:
  - path: "CLAUDE.md"
    description: "Project instructions and stack definition"
    sections: ["Stack Tecnologico", "Ultima Actualizacion"]
  - path: "docs/plan/MASTER-PLAN.md"
    description: "Master implementation plan"
    sections: ["Fases de Implementacion"]
  - path: "docs/plan/PROGRESS.md"
    description: "Progress tracking checklist"
    sections: ["Implementacion"]
  # - path: "docs/plan/exploration-index.md"
  #   description: "Exploration index"
  #   sections: []

# Agent behavior
auto_update: true          # true = agent updates files directly; false = report only
mark_synced: true          # Add sync_status/last_synced to ADR frontmatter

# ADR frontmatter fields managed by the plugin
# These are added/updated automatically:
#   sync_status: pending | synced
#   last_synced: YYYY-MM-DD

# Project Architecture Context

Describe your project's documentation structure here. This helps the agent
understand what each file represents and how to update it.

## Repository Structure

<!-- Example:
- CLAUDE.md: Project instructions, stack definition, conventions
- docs/plan/MASTER-PLAN.md: Implementation phases with task checklists
- docs/plan/PROGRESS.md: Completion tracking with checkboxes
- docs/architecture/decisions/: ADR files (this plugin manages these)
-->

## ADR Conventions

<!-- Example:
- Format: ADR-NNN-titulo-kebab-case.md
- Required for: library choices, design patterns, migration strategies, stack changes
- Structure: Context → Decision → Consequences → Alternatives
-->

## Sync Rules

<!-- Example:
- When an ADR changes the tech stack, update the Stack table in CLAUDE.md
- When an ADR adds implementation tasks, add them to MASTER-PLAN.md phases
- When an ADR is created, mark it as completed in PROGRESS.md
- Always update "Ultima Actualizacion" in CLAUDE.md
